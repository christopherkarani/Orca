# Changelog

## v1.2.5 - 2026-07-01

### Changed
- Pi block and ask states now use compact, branded Orca decision cards with clearer reason hierarchy and bounded long-text wrapping.
- Rust hook output and OpenCode/OpenClaw fallback copy now identify Orca explicitly across block and ask states.

### Fixed
- Pi decision cards use the stable above-editor widget surface and remain aligned for long or unbroken reasons.

## v1.2.4 - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`--live` / `--tui` alt-screen views** for `history` and `replay`.
- **Reduced-motion support** across TUI spinners and animations.
- **OSC 11 background detection** for automatic light/dark theme wiring.
- **Branded first-run celebration** and improved onboarding moments.
- **Pi slash commands** `/orca-start` and `/orca-stop` for session-level protection control.

### Changed
- **`--no-rich`** and `ORCA_NO_RICH=1` now gate color without changing machine-readable output.
- `--tui` + `--json` is rejected at preflight to prevent mixed output modes.

### Fixed
- CLI self-import support in the build.
- Replay/history live help and banner rejection edge cases.
- Phase 6 public contract freeze: exact bytes preserved for JSON, robot, export, and MCP proxy paths.

## v1.2.3 - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **OpenCode plugin** — Update for OpenCode 1.16 plugin API so `tool.execute.before` blocking works again.

## v1.2.0 - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Rust daemon (`orca-daemon`)** — UDS IPC between Zig CLI and Rust evaluator; shell hook evaluation routed through daemon with fail-closed behavior when unavailable.
- **`orca evaluate`** — Stable machine JSON API for shell command evaluation (`--json --stdin`).
- **`orca start`** — Guided onboarding flow with host detection and plugin install.
- **Pi extension (`@orca-guard/pi-orca`)** — Official Pi package for bash tool-call protection via `orca evaluate`.
- **Bundled `orca-daemon`** in all platform release archives and install layouts.

### Changed
- **Zig 0.16.0** toolchain migration.
- **Guided onboarding** — Interactive `orca setup` with multi-host selection.
- **Unified versioning** — Core and all agent plugins aligned to 1.2.0.
- Shell `PreToolUse` / tool evaluation defaults route through Rust daemon when available.

### Removed
- **Orca Edge** — Drone/edge runtime removed from public core; agent guardrails focus only.

### Fixed
- **Hermes Agent** — Orca discovery, degraded-mode handling, and version mismatch fixes.
- **Pi integration** — Honor deny decisions, timeouts, cwd, and auto unavailable mode.
- Install/DX hardening — quick-install presets, `orca doctor` activation exports, piped install robustness.

## v1.1.5 - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **`orca disable`** — Remove Orca plugin registrations from host agents without touching binary or policy.
- **`orca uninstall`** — Full removal of plugins, binary, and user config (preserves workspace `.orca/`).

## v1.1.4 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **OpenClaw plugin:** Detect and warn when `api.on` is a no-op for npm installs, preventing silent hook bypass.
- **Core stability:** Fix invalid free in redteam fixture root handling; prevent waitpid panic after watchdog kill in credentials broker.
- **CLI:** Add `--ci` shorthand for `orca run --ci`; auto-resolve fixture root via `resource_root` in `orca redteam`.

### Changed
- **Unified versioning:** All components — core, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Hermes, Codex, and Claude Code plugins — now share version 1.1.4.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-05-12

- Prepared Orca production release metadata and artifact contract.
- Prepared Edge Linux release artifacts for simulation/SITL/customer-evaluation and bench-preparation only.
- Added checksum, release-manifest, SBOM inventory hook, optional signing hook status, install guidance, GitHub release draft, tagging instructions, release checklist, and production-readiness report.
- Preserved explicit limitations: not real-flight readiness, not certification, not detect-and-avoid, not autopilot replacement, and no hosted telemetry by default.

## Previous Phases

Phases 23 through 40 established the product split, core ABI, CLI hardening, Edge domain model, policy engine, MAVLink/PX4/ArduPilot SITL integrations, safety enforcement, operator approval, audit/replay, red-team, data guard, deployment/ARM64 diagnostics, runtime health, customer proof, pilot package, and final security/safety hardening review.
