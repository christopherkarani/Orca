# Changelog

## v1.1.4 - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **OpenClaw plugin:** Detect and warn when `api.on` is a no-op for npm installs, preventing silent hook bypass.
- **Core stability:** Fix invalid free in redteam fixture root handling; prevent waitpid panic after watchdog kill in credentials broker.
- **CLI:** Add `--ci` shorthand for `orca run --ci`; auto-resolve fixture root via `resource_root` in `orca redteam`.

### Changed
- **Unified versioning:** All components — core, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Hermes, Codex, and Claude Code plugins — now share version 1.1.4.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-05-12

- Prepared Orca production release metadata and artifact contract.
- Prepared Edge Linux release artifacts for simulation/SITL/customer-evaluation and bench-preparation only.
- Added checksum, release-manifest, SBOM inventory hook, optional signing hook status, install guidance, GitHub release draft, tagging instructions, release checklist, and production-readiness report.
- Preserved explicit limitations: not real-flight readiness, not certification, not detect-and-avoid, not autopilot replacement, and no hosted telemetry by default.
